A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/kathy0123/pen/xVXOzq.

 The classic game, played against an AI opponent. Applies the [minimax algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) to pick its moves. Coded as a multi-threaded app using a web worker.

Web workers require code to be executed from separate JavaScript files. The code here is the UI thread. If you want to see the web worker code, check out [Align 4 Game (Web Worker)](http://codepen.io/lonekorean/pen/KnaJf).

Higher difficulty levels are computationally expensive, so the computer's turn may take a while, especially on mobile devices.
